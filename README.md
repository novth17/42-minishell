This file and folder structure looks very solid, I want something like this:

https://github.com/tjensen42/42-minishell/tree/main/

Git usage:

git fetch:

Downloads changes from the remote (new commits, branches, etc.) but doesn’t merge them into your local branch.
Great for checking what's new without affecting your local work.

git pull:

Does fetch + merge in one step — it downloads changes and immediately merges them into your current branch.
If there are conflicts, you'll have to resolve them before proceeding.

git merge:

Add changes from main to your branch. For example before pull request.
