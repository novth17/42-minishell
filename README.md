# Minishell
**As beautiful as a shell**

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Minishell is a simple Unix shell implementation written in C. This project is part of the 42 curriculum and aims to deepen the understanding of process management, file descriptors, and system calls.

## Features

- Custom interactive prompt.
- Command execution via absolute, relative paths, or `$PATH` resolution.
- Handle input/output redirections (`<`, `>`, `<<`, `>>`).
- Implement pipes (`|`) for command chaining.
- Environment variable expansion (`$VAR` and `$?`).
- Built-in commands:  
  - `echo` (with `-n` option)  
  - `cd` (with relative/absolute paths)  
  - `pwd`  
  - `export`  
  - `unset`  
  - `env`  
  - `exit`  
- Signal handling (`Ctrl-C`, `Ctrl-D`, `Ctrl-\`).
- Command history support.

## Git usage:

### git fetch:

Downloads changes from the remote (new commits, branches, etc.) but doesnâ€™t merge them into your local branch. Great for checking what's new without affecting your local work.

### git pull:

Does fetch + merge in one step â€” it downloads changes and immediately merges them into your current branch. If there are conflicts, you'll have to resolve them before proceeding.

### git merge:

Add changes from main to your branch. For example before pull request.
From main branch to your own branch: `git merge main`

### creating branch command flow:

git checkout main  
git pull  
git checkout -b branch-name
